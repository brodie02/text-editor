# Coding Bootcamp Week 19 Challenge - Text Editor

## Description

This weeks challenge focused on adding the finishing touches to a PWA text editor. A service worker was added so the app could run if the server was down, a manifest was created so the app could be installed. And, indexedDB was used to store what the user writes on the text editor.
